Here is a new post with some code in it

This is some javascript

```js
// I am a comment
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "gatsby-theme-blog", // highlight-line
    "gatsby-theme-notes"
  ]
};
```

And here is some JSX

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "theme-ui";
import theme from "./theme";

// I am a comment
export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
);
```
